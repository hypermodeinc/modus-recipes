## Uranus

**Uranus** is the seventh planet from the [Sun](/wiki/Sun "Sun"). It has the third-largest planetary
radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to
[Neptune](/wiki/Neptune "Neptune"), and both are of different chemical composition than the larger
gas giants [Jupiter](/wiki/Jupiter "Jupiter") and [Saturn](/wiki/Saturn "Saturn"). For this reason,
astronomers sometimes place them in a separate category called "ice giants". Uranus's atmosphere,
although similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium,
contains more "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of hydrocarbons.

Uranus has the coldest planetary atmosphere in the
[Solar System](/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System"), with minimum temperatures being 49 K (-371 °F,
-224 °C).
