## Saturn

**Saturn** is the sixth planet from the [Sun](/wiki/Sun "Sun"), and the second largest planet in our
[Solar System](/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System"), next to [Jupiter](/wiki/Jupiter "Jupiter").
Saturn is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth. While only one-eighth
the average density of Earth, with its larger volume Saturn is just over 95 times more massive.

Saturn's interior is probably composed of a core of iron, nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen
compounds), surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid
hydrogen and liquid helium and an outer gaseous layer.

Saturn is most famous for it's prominent ring system that consists of nine continuous main rings and
three discontinuous arcs, composed mostly of ice particles with a smaller amount of rocky debris and
dust.
