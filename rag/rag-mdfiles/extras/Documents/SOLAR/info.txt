# The Solar System: A Comprehensive Guide

The Solar System is a dynamic and intricate collection of planets, moons, and other celestial
bodies, orbiting around the Sun. It has fascinated humanity for millennia, influencing discoveries
in science, inspiring artistic works, and guiding space exploration.

# Sun: The Heart of the Solar System

## Overview

The **Sun** is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V) located at the center of our Solar System. It
accounts for more than 99% of the total mass of the system and emits light and heat necessary for
life on Earth.

### Key Facts

- **Mass**: 1.989 × 10^30 kg
- **Diameter**: 1.39 million km
- **Age**: 4.6 billion years
- **Surface Temperature**: ~5,500°C

### Discovery

Humans have known and studied the Sun for thousands of years, but it wasn't until the works of
**Nicolaus Copernicus** in the 16th century that we understood its role at the center of the solar
system.

### References in Culture

- **Movies**: _Sunshine_ (2007), explores the importance of the Sun and the dangers of its possible
  extinction.

# Mercury: The Swift Messenger

## Overview

**Mercury** is the smallest and fastest planet in the Solar System, orbiting closest to the Sun. It
is a rocky planet with a barren surface filled with craters, resembling our Moon.

### Key Facts

- **Orbital Period**: 88 Earth days
- **Diameter**: 4,880 km
- **Temperature**: -173°C to 427°C (extreme day-night variation)
- **Moons**: None

### Discovery

First observed by ancient civilizations, Mercury's elliptical orbit was well documented by
**Ptolemy**. Its proximity to the Sun made it hard to study until the development of modern
telescopes.

### References in Culture

- **Movies**: _The Expanse_ series includes scenes set on Mercury, depicting its harsh environment.
- **Books**: _The Left Hand of Darkness_ by Ursula K. Le Guin briefly mentions Mercury as a
  reference to extreme planetary environments.

# Venus: Earth's Fiery Twin

## Overview

**Venus**, often referred to as Earth’s twin, is similar in size and composition but vastly
different in climate, with a runaway greenhouse effect making it the hottest planet.

### Key Facts

- **Orbital Period**: 225 Earth days
- **Diameter**: 12,104 km
- **Temperature**: ~465°C
- **Atmosphere**: Thick clouds of sulfuric acid
- **Moons**: None

### Discovery

Venus has been known since ancient times. It was initially thought to be two separate
objects—**Phosphorus** in the morning and **Hesperus** in the evening—until astronomers confirmed
its single identity.

### References in Culture

- **Movies**: _Venus_ (2017), explores the complex emotional landscape of identity, metaphorically
  linked to the planet's dual visibility.
- **Books**: _Out of the Silent Planet_ by C.S. Lewis uses Venus (Malacandra) as a symbol of beauty
  and mystery.

# Earth: The Blue Marble

## Overview

**Earth** is the third planet from the Sun and the only planet known to support life. Its surface is
mostly water, earning it the nickname "The Blue Planet."

### Key Facts

- **Orbital Period**: 365.25 days
- **Diameter**: 12,742 km
- **Temperature**: 15°C on average
- **Moons**: 1 (The Moon)
- **Water Coverage**: 71%

### Discovery

Though our understanding of Earth has grown, it wasn't until **Galileo**’s observations in the 17th
century that we had definitive proof of Earth’s place in the solar system.

### References in Culture

- **Movies**: _Interstellar_ (2014) explores the fragility of Earth in a time of environmental
  catastrophe.
- **Books**: _The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy_ by Douglas Adams humorously portrays Earth as
  insignificant in the grand scheme of the universe.

# Mars: The Red Planet

## Overview

**Mars** has captured human imagination for centuries, with its red color and the possibility of
water under its surface sparking dreams of human colonization.

### Key Facts

- **Orbital Period**: 687 Earth days
- **Diameter**: 6,779 km
- **Moons**: 2 (Phobos and Deimos)
- **Surface Temperature**: -63°C on average

### Discovery

Mars was known to ancient astronomers, but modern study began with **Giovanni Schiaparelli** in
1877, who mapped its surface and incorrectly identified canals, leading to theories about Martian
life.

### References in Culture

- **Movies**: _The Martian_ (2015) portrays a stranded astronaut's survival on Mars.
- **Books**: _The War of the Worlds_ by H.G. Wells introduced the idea of Martians invading Earth.
