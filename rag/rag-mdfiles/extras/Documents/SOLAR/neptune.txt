# Neptune

**Neptune** is the eighth and farthest planet from the [Sun](/wiki/Sun "Sun"). It is the
fourth-largest planet by diameter and the third-largest by mass. Among the gaseous planets in the
Solar System, Neptune is the most dense out of them. Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth and is
slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus, which is 15 times the mass of Earth but not as
dense as Neptune. Neptune orbits the sun at an average of 30.1 astronomical units. The planet is
named after the Roman god of the sea, "Neptune", so the planet's astronomical symbol is Neptune's
trident (♆).

Neptune was found by a mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected
changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to
gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. Neptune was then subsequently observed on September
23, 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Urbain Le Verrier, and its
largest moon, [Triton](/wiki/Triton "Triton"), was discovered shortly afterwards, but none of the
planet's remaining 13 moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. Neptune was visited
by [Voyager 2](/wiki/Voyager_2 "Voyager 2"), when it flew by the planet on August 25, 1989.

Neptune is similar in composition to Uranus, and both have compositions that differ from those of
the larger gas giants, [Jupiter](/wiki/Jupiter "Jupiter") and [Saturn](/wiki/Saturn "Saturn").
Neptune's atmosphere, like Jupiter and Saturn's, is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, along
with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen; it contains a higher proportion of "ices" such as
water, ammonia, and methane.

### Moons

Neptune has 14 [moons](https://astronomical.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Moons_of_Neptune).

**Sounds**

The equatorial regions of Neptune possess average wind speeds of over 700 mph, which is faster than
the speed of sound here on Earth. Like Jupiter and Saturn, **Neptune radiates more hear than it
receives**.
