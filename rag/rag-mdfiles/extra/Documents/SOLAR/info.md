# Venus: Earth's Fiery Twin

## Overview

**Venus**, often referred to as Earth’s twin, is similar in size and composition but vastly different in climate, with a runaway greenhouse effect making it the hottest planet.

### Key Facts

- **Orbital Period**: 225 Earth days
- **Diameter**: 12,104 km
- **Temperature**: ~465°C
- **Atmosphere**: Thick clouds of sulfuric acid
- **Moons**: None

### Discovery

Venus has been known since ancient times. It was initially thought to be two separate objects—**Phosphorus** in the morning and **Hesperus** in the evening—until astronomers confirmed its single identity.

### References in Culture

- **Movies**: _Venus_ (2017), explores the complex emotional landscape of identity, metaphorically linked to the planet's dual visibility.
- **Books**: _Out of the Silent Planet_ by C.S. Lewis uses Venus (Malacandra) as a symbol of beauty and mystery.

# Earth: The Blue Marble

## Overview

**Earth** is the third planet from the Sun and the only planet known to support life. Its surface is mostly water, earning it the nickname "The Blue Planet."

### Key Facts

- **Orbital Period**: 365.25 days
- **Diameter**: 12,742 km
- **Temperature**: 15°C on average
- **Moons**: 1 (The Moon)
- **Water Coverage**: 71%

### Discovery

Though our understanding of Earth has grown, it wasn't until **Galileo**’s observations in the 17th century that we had definitive proof of Earth’s place in the solar system.

### References in Culture

- **Movies**: _Interstellar_ (2014) explores the fragility of Earth in a time of environmental catastrophe.
- **Books**: _The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy_ by Douglas Adams humorously portrays Earth as insignificant in the grand scheme of the universe.
