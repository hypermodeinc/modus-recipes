<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the Template Project">
    Use the [template](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/base-template) to set up your Hypermode project.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Your Manifest">
    Define your [AI models](/define-models) in your [project manifest](/manifest). You'll reference these model definitions in your functions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write Your Functions">
    Use the [Functions SDK](/sdk/functions-sdk) to write your functions. Expose your functions through the project [schema](/define-schema).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Iterate">
    Hypermode makes it easy to iterate on your AI features.

    Want to try a new model? Add a new entry to your manifest and update your function. It's that easy!
