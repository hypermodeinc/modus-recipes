# GitHub Issue Knowledge Base Generator (Modus + Hypermode) üöÄ

This project automatically generates a Knowledge Base (KB) article when a GitHub issue is closed. It utilizes Hypermode and Modus (a serverless Go framework) to process issue data and generate a structured KB article using an LLM. The article is then posted as a GitHub Discussion.

## üõ† Features

- Fetches GitHub issue details and comments upon issue closure.
- Uses LLM (Hugging Face model via Hypermode) to generate a detailed KB article.
- Posts the generated KB article as a GitHub Discussion.
- Can be triggered manually or via GitHub Actions.

## üñ•Ô∏è Running Locally

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Modus

First, install Modus CLI:

```
npm install -g @hypermodeinc/modus
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
cd YOUR_REPO
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Modus Dev Server

```
modus dev
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Test the API Locally

Go to:

```
http://localhost:54321/graphql
```

You'll see an exported function `issueClosedHandler`. Test the KB Article Generation. Enter the repository name and issue number and run the query. The API will return a formatted KB article. You can also post the KB Article as a Discussion. To do so, pass a GitHub API token as well.

## üöÄ Deploying to Hypermode

To deploy the function to Hypermode:

```
modus deploy
```

Once deployed, copy your Hypermode endpoint, which will be used in the GitHub Action.

## üîß Setting Up the GitHub Action

This action allows the KB article to be generated automatically when an issue is closed.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Project & Deploy to Hypermode

If you haven't already:

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
cd YOUR_REPO
modus deploy
```

Copy your Hypermode endpoint.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Add the GitHub Action

Copy the issue-summarizer.yml file into in your repository:

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Add Your Hypermode API Key to GitHub Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository.
2. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions.
3. Click New repository secret.
4. Name it: `HYPERMODE_API_KEY`
5. Paste your Hypermode API key.
6. Save.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Done! üéâ

Now, every time a GitHub issue is closed, a KB article will be generated and posted as a GitHub Discussion.

Ensure:

- You have enabled Discussions under Repository Settings ‚Üí Features.
