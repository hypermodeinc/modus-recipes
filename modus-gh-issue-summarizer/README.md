# GitHub Issue Knowledge Base Generator (Modus + Hypermode) üöÄ

This project automatically generates a Knowledge Base (KB) article when a GitHub issue is closed. It
utilizes Hypermode and Modus (a serverless Go framework) to process issue data and generate a
structured KB article using an LLM. The knowledge base article is then posted as a GitHub
Discussion.

## üõ† Features

- Fetches GitHub issue details and comments upon issue closure.
- Uses LLM (Meta's LLaMa model hosted on Hypermode) to generate a detailed KB article.
- Posts the generated KB article as a GitHub Discussion.
- Can be triggered manually or via GitHub Actions.

## üñ•Ô∏è Running Locally

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Modus

First, install Modus CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @hypermodeinc/modus-cli
```

We'll be using Go for this project so you'll also want to make sure you have
[Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) and [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/getting-started/install/) installed
as well.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Modus Dev Server

```bash
modus dev
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Test the API Locally With Your GitHub Repository

To test the API locally you'll need a public GitHub repository and a GitHub issue number to use for
the knowledge base article.

Go to: `http://localhost:8686/explorer`

You'll see an exported function `issueClosedHandler`. Test the KB Article Generation. Enter the
repository name and issue number and run the query. The API will return a formatted KB article. You
can also post the KB Article as a Discussion. To do so, pass a GitHub API token as well.

## üöÄ Deploying to Hypermode

See [the Hypermode docs for instructions](https://docs.hypermode.com/deploy) to deploy this project
to Hypermode.

Once deployed, copy your Hypermode endpoint, which will be used in the GitHub Action.

--

## üîß Setting Up the GitHub Action

This action allows the KB article to be generated automatically when an issue is closed. Be sure to
follow the step above to deploy your Modus project to Hypermode.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Add the GitHub Action

Copy the `workflows/issue-summarizer.yml` file into in your repository:

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Add Your Hypermode API Key to GitHub Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository.
2. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions.
3. Click New repository secret.
4. Name it: `HYPERMODE_API_KEY`
5. Paste your Hypermode API key.
6. Save.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Done! üéâ

Now, every time a GitHub issue is closed, a KB article will be generated and posted as a GitHub
Discussion.

## üõ† Troubleshooting

GitHub Discussion Not Created?

Ensure:

- You have enabled Discussions under Repository Settings ‚Üí Features.
- Your GitHub token has the discussions: write permission.

No Response from the API?

- Check if your Modus function is deployed.
- Verify that your Hypermode API key is correct in GitHub Secrets.
